# IMSAT_torch

This is a reproduction of "Learning Discrete Representations via Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training" (IMSAT).  
This code is being used in the paper "Deep Clustering via Mutual InformationMaximization with Local Smoothness andTopological Invariant Constraints"

## Usage

1. Download the datasets used in the paper:  
[to be uploaded]

2. Run `IMSAT.py` to run IMSAT. hyper-parameters can be assigned via command-line arguments.
